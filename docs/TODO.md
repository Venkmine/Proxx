# PROXX — CURRENT FOCUS

## COMPLETED PHASES

- Phase 1 — Project scaffolding (Electron + React frontend, FastAPI backend, health check IPC)
- Phase 2 — Preset system foundations (data model, validation, in-memory registry)
- Phase 3 — Metadata engine foundations (extraction, validation, workflow flags)
- Phase 4 — Job engine foundations (job/task models, state transitions, orchestration)
- Phase 5 — Resolve integration foundations (discovery, validation, command preparation)
- Phase 6 — Execution pipeline (single clip)
- Phase 7 — Job execution (multi-clip, sequential)
- Phase 8 — Reporting & diagnostics (job/clip reports, CSV/JSON/TXT output)
- Phase 9 — Monitoring server (read-only job status visibility)
- Phase 10 — Watch folders & unattended ingestion (polling-based discovery, stability detection, job creation)
- Phase 11 — Preset application & execution automation (explicit binding, opt-in auto-execution, safety checks)
- Phase 12 — Persistence & recovery (SQLite storage, explicit save/load, RECOVERY_REQUIRED status, honest recovery detection)
- Phase 13 — Operator control & intent surfaces (CLI commands: resume, retry, cancel, rebind; explicit operator intent only)
- Phase 14 — Minimal operator UI (read-only job/clip visibility + explicit control buttons; HTTP control endpoints; confirmation-gated actions)
