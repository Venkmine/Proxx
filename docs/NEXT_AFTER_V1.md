Missing ability to save / load / delete / edit presets


Watermarks not updated - still missing positional preview ui feature with title safe grid on top just like editready. 

Colour mode non-functional 

Resolution & Framerate Presets should be at the top level not under "Custom dimensions" or "custom frame rate".

If adding custom dimensions which don't follow native aspect ratio we we letterbox / scale / stretch / squeeze here- what options?
