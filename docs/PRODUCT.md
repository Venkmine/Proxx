# PROXX — PRODUCT DEFINITION

## What Proxx Is

Proxx is a Resolve-orchestrated, unattended, studio-grade proxy and transcode engine.

It is designed to:
- Run overnight without supervision
- Survive bad footage, bad mounts, bad assistants, and bad Macs
- Produce editorial-ready proxies with provable outcomes
- Be trusted more than human babysitting

Resolve Studio is the render engine.  
Proxx owns orchestration, presets, metadata, reliability, and reporting.

## What Proxx Is Not

Proxx is not:
- A copy or ingest tool
- A media management system
- A creative color pipeline
- A consumer application
- A chat interface
- A general FFmpeg wrapper

If a feature drifts toward any of the above, it is out of scope by default.

## Target Users

- Assistant editors
- Post-production engineers
- Studio tech teams
- Facilities running Resolve at scale

Not hobbyists.

## Success Criteria

Success is defined as:
- Jobs complete unattended
- Failures are visible, explainable, and non-blocking
- Outputs can be trusted without manual spot checking
