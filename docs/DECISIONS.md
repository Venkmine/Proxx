# PROXX — IRREVERSIBLE DECISIONS

Only decisions that should never be re-litigated live here.

## Resolve

- Resolve Studio is required for v1.x
- Headless or scripted Resolve operation is preferred
- Resolve Free mode is deferred and caveated

## Codecs

- ProRes, DNxHR, and DNxHD are supported
- DNxHD included for legacy Avid pipelines
- Intra-frame codecs are editorial defaults
- Long-GOP codecs warn but do not block

## Presets

- Global presets reference category presets
- Category presets are reusable libraries
- Presets are data, not hardcoded logic

## Reliability

- Warn-and-continue is the default
- Filesystem is the final authority
- Reports are first-class outputs
