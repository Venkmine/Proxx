# QA Fixtures

This directory contains test fixtures for the Verify QA system.

## Generated Fixtures

Test media files are generated at runtime using FFmpeg.
This ensures:
- No large binary files in the repository
- Deterministic, reproducible test content
- Fixtures tailored to specific test needs

## Generating Fixtures

Fixtures are generated by the test harness automatically.
To manually generate a test video:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -f lavfi -i "color=c=red:s=320x240:d=1" \
       -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=440:duration=1" \
       -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -shortest \
       test_input.mp4
```

## Fixture Types

| Type | Duration | Resolution | Purpose |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| minimal | 1s | 320x240 | Fast unit tests |
| standard | 5s | 1920x1080 | Integration tests |
| full | 30s | 1920x1080 | E2E validation |

## Storage Policy

- Generated fixtures are NOT committed to git
- Add `qa/fixtures/*.mp4` to .gitignore
- Each test is responsible for its own cleanup
